**Description**

This dataset is a transcribed version of the data from Table 33 of the Twelfth Census of the United States, completed in 1900. The original PDF version of this data can be found [here](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1900/volume-1/volume-1-p13.pdf), provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Though this data was previously inaccessible due to the poor quality of the PDF, it is now publicly available and can be used to explore how statewide communities have evolved since the turn of the last century. Consider diving into a single state for a granular approach, or examining how the demographics of a region in 1900 have impacted the culture there today.

**Methodology**

To transcribe the data, Stacker staff first used [pdftoexcel.com](https://www.pdftoexcel.com/). This yielded a poorly formatted and inaccurate spreadsheet. This base transcription was reformatted, corrected, and checked by hand, resulting in this final product.
