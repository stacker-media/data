**Description**

This dataset is a transcribed version of the data from Table 35 of the Twelfth Census of the United States, completed in 1900. The original PDF version of this data can be found [here](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1900/volume-1/volume-1-p13.pdf), provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Though this data was previously inaccessible due to the poor quality of the PDF, it is now publicly available and can be used to explore how metropolitan communities have evolved since the turn of the last century.

**Methodology**

To transcribe the data, Stacker staff first used [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/). This yielded a more readable format, but still included errors. This base transcription was reformatted, corrected, and checked by hand, resulting in this final product.
