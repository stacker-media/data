<b>Description</b>

This dataset is a transcribed version of the data from Table XXVII of the Ninth Census of the United States, completed in 1870, and contains a state-by-state breakdown of occupation data. The original PDF version of this data can be found here, provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Though this data was previously inaccessible due to the poor quality of the PDF, it is now publicly available and can be used to explore how statewide workforces have evolved since the end of the 19th century. Consider diving into a single state for a granular approach, or examining how the working population of a region in 1870 has influenced the economy there today.


<b>Methodology</b>

To transcribe the data, Stacker staff first used Amazon Textract. This returned a typewritten dataset in CSV format, but contained some gaps and some errors. This base transcription was reformatted, corrected, and checked by hand, resulting in this final product.
